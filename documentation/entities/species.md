# Species

## Required fields

A species has the following required fields in the database:

- `species_id`
- `class_name`
- `order_name`
- `family_name`
- `genus_name`
- `species_name`
- `unique_identifier`

All of these are also required when editing or creating a new species (with the exception of `species_id`). The `class_name` is set to "Mammalia" by default and cannot be edited.
