### Time Bound

A Time Bound can be given the following information:

- Name (`b_name`)
- Age (`age`)
- A comment (`b_comment`)

The Name and Age fields are currently required by the validators, but the comment field is optional.

The Time Bound's detail view also has a tab for viewing which time units use the time bound.
