### TimeBoundSelection Component

The TimeBoundSelection component is almost exactly the same as `FieldWithTableSelection` components, but when its value is changed, it also updates the `up_bound` or `low_bound` object in editData.

Should not be used for purposes other than time bound/time unit editing!

Check the documentation for [FieldWithTableSelection](./editingComponents/FieldWithTableSelection.md)
