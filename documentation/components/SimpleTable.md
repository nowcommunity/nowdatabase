# SimpleTable

[SimpleTable](../../frontend/src/components/DetailView/common/SimpleTable.tsx) is a simple component as its name suggests. If it is a table of entities, it can have links to the detail views of those entities. To add links to a SimpleTable, give it the `idFieldName` and `url` parameters.
