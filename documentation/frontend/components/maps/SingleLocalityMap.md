# Single locality map

A component for visualizing the location of a single latitude and longitude coordinate, used for the locality detail page as well as in a country bounding box check warning modal to illustrate the location with the box it missed.

The component takes in decimal-form latitude and longitude coordinates, along with an optional array of bounding boxes to display on the map.
