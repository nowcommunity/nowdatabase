### Cross Search Export

Cross search has a [`/export` route](../../backend/src/routes/crossSearch.ts) which is used by the ["Export Table"](../../../frontend/src/components/CrossSearch/CrossSearchExportButton.tsx) button in a cross-search table view. This route uses the same parameter parsing and validation function as the `/all` route, and it also uses the same SQL query, but with LIMIT set to undefined. The resulting data is [streamed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) to the user, where the browser will download it as a csv file. See the "Exporting" section in [TableView docs](../frontend/components/TableView.md) for more information.
